              <h2>Who We Are</h2>
              <p>
                We are a team of healthcare professionals and technologists focused on transforming Electronic Health Records (EHR). Our goal is to create a secure, user-friendly platform for EHR management.
              </p>

              <h2>What We Do</h2>
              <p>
                Our system offers a comprehensive solution for doctors, patients, and diagnostic centers. By using Ethereum blockchain, we ensure secure data storage, with smart contracts enabling access control.
              </p>

              <h3>For Doctors</h3>
              <p>
                Doctors can view their assigned patient list, examine medical records and histories, and update treatment plans and comments.
              </p>

              <h3>For Patients</h3>
              <p>
                Patients can access their own medical records, upload new documents, and manage access permissions for their doctors.
              </p>

              <h3>For Diagnostic Centers</h3>
              <p>
                Diagnostic centers can review doctors' comments and treatment plans, and upload EHR reports to patient records.
              </p>

              <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
              <p>
                We prioritize the security and integrity of patient data. Our system ensures only authorized users can access patient records. Patients have full control over who can view their information and can grant or revoke access at any time.
              </p>
